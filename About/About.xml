	<description>"Greatest hauling mod ever" - Chicken Plucker

	v.1.0.6
	
Colonists will gather stuff in their inventory, then haul it all to a stockpile.

This hauling mod will greatly increase hauling efficiency, because pawns can now carry more than one gun or t-shirt. Those smart and intelligent colonists can use their inventory!

Works well in combination with Combat Extended, AllowTool's Haul Urgently, etc. No known conflicts.

Safe to add to existing games. &lt;size=20&gt;Credits and thanks:&lt;/size&gt;
- AlexTD, for his direct contributions
- erdelf, Zorba, Why_is_that and Dingo for code and advice (yet again!)
- Chicken Plucker, for the preview image
- Brrainz, for the amazing Harmony library
